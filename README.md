## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1
1. Classically, the Subscriber is defined as an interface (or trait in Rust). This is preferred so the App can implement multiple different subscribers. However, for BambangShop the single Model would suffice since all subscribers are handled identically. However, this can lead to problems further on because scalability is poor.
2. DashMaps provides O(1) lookup/insertions/deletions by key (id or url), whihle Vec only has O(n) searches. This means DashMaps are preferred due to its fast operations on large-scale data.
3. Singletons ensure single instance, but it doesn't solve thread safety. In contrast, a DashMap provides a thread-safe implementation of HashMaps. This means Dashmaps are preferred over manually locked singletons for scalable, thread-safety data access.

#### Reflection Publisher-2
1. Repository handles database operations like fetching, saving, and updating data, while service handles business logic. Only using model means we mix database logic and business logic, making code harder to maintain. Testing is also harder since the logics are tightly coupled. In other words, harder to swap components with different implementation.
2. Each model would have to handle multiple responsibilities which increases complexity. Tightly coupled interactions complicates maintainance, leading to potential issues when scaling the codebase.
3. Yes, Postman enhances collaboration by allowing teams to share collections. Its team feature ensures seamless synchronization of workspaces, making testing and API documentation more efficient for all team members.
